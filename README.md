Matrices Project
================

Developing a series of functions in Pascal to performe Matrix operations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



In this project I will be building a series of seperable functions, that can be used interchangably.

I started with input and output, then checking the order of and multiplying matrices.
Next I might start working on Inversing and finding Eigenvectors, but we shall see...
