Matrices Project
================
Developing a series of functions in Pascal to perform Matrix operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


###In this project I will be building a series of seperable functions, that can be used interchangably.

I started with input and output, then checking the order of and multiplying matrices.
I'm currently working on using Elementary Row Operations to find the inverse of a matrix.
Next I might start working finding Eigenvectors, but we'll see...
